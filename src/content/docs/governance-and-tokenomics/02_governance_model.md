## Decentralized Decision-Making

$FORGE token holders shape the platformâ€™s future by participating in governance. This includes voting on feature updates, AI integrations, and platform optimizations.

## Proposal System

- **Who Can Propose?** Any user with a predefined stake of $FORGE can submit proposals.

- **Voting Power**: Weighted based on the amount of $FORGE staked.

- **Execution**: Successful proposals are implemented transparently, with on-chain records.

## Community Treasury

A portion of platform revenue is allocated to a treasury controlled by the community. It funds development initiatives, partnerships, and rewards for contributors.
