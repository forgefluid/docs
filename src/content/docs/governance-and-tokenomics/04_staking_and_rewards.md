## Staking Mechanism

$FORGE holders can stake tokens to unlock benefits and earn rewards.

  - **Minimum Stake Requirements**: Users must stake a specified amount to access higher-tier features.

  - **Lock-in Periods**: Staked tokens are locked for a duration, with early withdrawal penalties to prevent abuse.

  - **Dynamic Tiers**: Staking levels define user states, determining access to premium features and benefits.

## Reward Mechanism

  - **Base Rewards**: Distributed daily based on staked amounts.

  - **Performance Multipliers**: Users engaging more with the platform (e.g., submitting workflows) receive bonus rewards.
