The AI engine powers smart contract generation, project customization, and task refinement.

- **Local Models**:

  - Python-based AI models using TensorFlow or PyTorch for on-premise tasks requiring high control and efficiency.

- **Third-Party APIs**:

  - OpenAI and Anthropic integrations via REST APIs for advanced natural language processing and code generation.

- **Task Coordination**:

  - AI requests are queued and managed by the backend for load balancing and efficient resource utilization.

- **Knowledge Base**: Kubernetes is used to deploy and scale AI workloads dynamically.
