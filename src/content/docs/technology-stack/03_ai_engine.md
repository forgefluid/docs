The AI engine powers smart contract generation, project customization, and task refinement.

- **Local Models**:

  - Python-based AI models using TensorFlow or PyTorch for on-premise tasks requiring high control and efficiency.

- **Third-Party APIs**:

  - OpenAI and Anthropic integrations via REST APIs for advanced natural language processing and code generation.

- **Task Coordination**:

  - AI requests are queued and managed by the backend for load balancing and efficient resource utilization.

- **Knowledge Base**: 

  - The platform integrates a robust AI knowledge base that leverages local models and third-party AI providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) to generate and refine smart contracts. 
  - This system combines natural language processing with domain-specific knowledge in blockchain, enabling efficient, secure, and high-quality code generation.
