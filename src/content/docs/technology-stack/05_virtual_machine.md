Sandboxed VMs isolate user-generated code for secure and independent execution.

- **Containerization**: Docker containers for lightweight, isolated environments.

- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes handles container lifecycle management and scaling.

- **Security**:

  - Each VM is sandboxed to prevent cross-project contamination.

  - Restricted network access to mitigate security risks.

  - Per-user isolated sandboxes

  - Secure code execution

- **Persistence**: Project files are automatically saved to storage and can be restored from any state.
