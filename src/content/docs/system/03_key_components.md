## The architecture integrates

1. **AI Task Processing**
The platform uses advanced AI models, hosted locally or accessed via third-party APIs, to generate high-quality smart contracts and custom scripts. These tasks are managed in real-time, prioritizing efficiency and accuracy.

2. **Sandboxed Execution**
Every user task is executed within a dedicated, isolated VM, ensuring security and privacy. The VM environment allows users to observe and refine their projects in real time while persisting generated files for future use.

3. **Payment Integration**
ForgeFluid supports both traditional (fiat) and Web3 (cryptocurrency) payment methods. The native $FORGE token enables fee reductions, task prioritization, and exclusive access to premium features.

4. **Persistent Storage**
Generated projects are securely stored using scalable cloud storage solutions, with replication and versioning capabilities to ensure reliability and data recovery.

5. **Queueing System**
A robust task queue optimizes processing by assigning priority to premium users, enabling efficient resource utilization during peak demand.

6. **Web3 Features**
With account abstraction, users can log in using traditional methods while linking to on-chain wallets. Multichain support ensures compatibility with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible networks, making deployment flexible and seamless.
