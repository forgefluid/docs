The platform isolates execution environments to ensure security and user privacy.

- **Isolated Virtual Machines**:

  - Each project runs in a dedicated VM to prevent data leaks or interference.

- **Code Testing**:

  - Users can execute generated contracts within the sandbox, identifying potential issues before deployment.

- **File Persistence**:

  - Project files are securely stored and accessible within the sandbox for continued development or redeployment.
