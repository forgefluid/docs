The platform leverages AI to generate high-quality, optimized smart contracts tailored to user needs.

- **Custom Code Generation**:

  - Users provide prompts detailing contract functionality and structure.

  - AI models analyze input to create contracts with clean, efficient, and secure code.

- **Modular Design**:

  - AI outputs are componentized, allowing users to reuse and integrate pieces of the generated code.

- **Version Control**:

  - Generated contracts are stored with version history for easy rollback or iterative improvements.

- **AI Flexibility**:

  - Users can choose between local models (for privacy and control) or third-party APIs like OpenAI, Anthorpic, etc.
